# Watcher Arduino Project

## Components Used

- Arduino Nano
- 2 x Ultrasonic Sensors
- Gyro Sensor
- Servo Motor
- LED
- Bluetooth Module

## Project Overview

The Watcher Arduino Project utilizes an Arduino Nano along with various sensors and components to create a monitoring system capable of detecting movement in its surroundings. The project employs two ultrasonic sensors, a gyro sensor, a servo motor, an LED, and a Bluetooth module to achieve its functionality.

## Functionality

- The system monitors its environment using two ultrasonic sensors.
- The servo motor allows the ultrasonic sensors to rotate and cover a 360-degree area.
- Movement detection is followed by a verification process.
- In case of detected movement, the system sends an RF signal.
- LED and buzzer indicators provide visual and auditory alerts.
- The gyro sensor provides orientation data.
- Bluetooth module enables wireless communication.

## Setup

1. Connect the components according to the provided circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (code) to the Arduino Nano.
3. Ensure all components are powered appropriately.

## Usage

1. Power on the system.
2. The system will start monitoring its environment.
3. If movement is detected, the verification process begins.
4. If verified, an RF signal is sent.
5. LED and buzzer indicators will provide alerts.
