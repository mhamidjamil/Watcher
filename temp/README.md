# Watcher
A basic purpose of this project was to connect and use multiple sensors with Arduino nano for security purpose.
# DIP project 
i link it with python (open CV) for my semester project (Digital image processing) OpenCV use laptop camera for face detection and use that data with arduino if the persone is authorized every thing will work fine but if any unathurize persone try to use laptop/computer then arduino will get the signal and you can perform any action like charging/power cut. Full project on ( https://github.com/mhamidjamil/Arduino_with_python_CV )
# ML project 
i use it in my Machine learning semester project too. I train a SVM modle base on movment if it detect movment around it, it will send data to other module or you can say it will alert the persone by multiple ways like send signal via internet or via RF (radio frequence) module.
